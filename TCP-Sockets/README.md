# Computer-Network-Projects

A server and client program was created so that the client can send a zipcode, and the server will reply by sending the corresponding city and state. 

To run: 

1) make

2) start the server: ./myserver [port no]

3) run the client on another program: ./myclient [server name e.g. localhost] [port no]

4) client will ask for zip number

Sample Output:

	[you@zap] myclient zip.csug.rochester.edu 32000 <enter>
	Enter zip: 14620<enter>
	City: Rochester 
	State: NY
	[you@zap]
